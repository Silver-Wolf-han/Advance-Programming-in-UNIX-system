## Objective

Use a `race condition` to obtain specific content from the server.
The method to trigger the `race condition` is by sending data to the server.
||And I didn’t manage to solve the third one ~~even though I overheard someone explaining the problem during the demo and figured out what was wrong~~ so I missed out on an A+.||
||I only found someone’s solution on GitHub after the semester ended, and it turned out to be *surprisingly simple*.||

## todo

1. In `cha_1.c:show_fortune`, this function is executed by different threads each time. While reading a file, it stores the filename in the global variable at `cha_1.c:20`, creating a race condition:
    ```
    thread 1 37 and passes validation                                     line 39 reads thread 2’s requested file
    thread 2                           29 overwrites the global variable

    ```
    If the execution order is like above, you can read the unintended file.
    So just keep trying until you read something like `flag{....`

2. At `cha_1.c:56`, there's a `get_hostbyname2` call. Just run `man get_hostbyname2` and you’ll see this function is **not** thread-safe. Yep, that’s it.
    :::warning
    The issue isn’t the `ent` variable returned at `cha_1.c:56`—it’s a memory problem with the function itself.
    :::
    Also, using this method, it takes around 2–3 minutes to finally get the flag.
    The TA mentioned that if the data you send is correct, you’ll get it right away.
    ||But I didn’t have the ability to figure that out myself.||

3. At `cha_3.c:136` and `cha_3.c:161`, the file descriptor (`fd`) is being closed twice—it seems.
    So under some conditions, `"password.txt"` is opened, and its content ends up being empty, which means sending empty username and password would pass the test. ~~But I couldn’t reproduce it.~~
    According to the solution I eventually found, the key point I overlooked was how to **decode the cookie**.
    I assumed once you get the cookie’s value the first time, you could just reuse it. But at `cha_3.c:192`, there's clearly a validation check, and I just totally ignored it.
    After decoding the cookie, the race condition is actually super straightforward: just repeatedly send requests and hope the first one causes "password.txt" to be closed before the second reads it.
    ||Also, this program tends to fail during the first 5–6 runs, then starts succeeding consistently afterward.||
