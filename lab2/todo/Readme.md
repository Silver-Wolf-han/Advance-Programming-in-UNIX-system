# Lab 2 have fun with kernel module

You need to create a Kernel Module.
It's relatively complex, so there’s a pre-lab practice beforehand, which is basically about:
1. How to launch a kernel
2. How to insert our program into the kernel

||It’s complicated—I didn’t really understand it either||

## Objective

The kernel module includes:

1. `write`  — input into the kernel
2. `read`  — output from the kernels
3. `ioctl` — control I/O

Follow the spec to implement these features.

## Todo

The code I wrote is under `312552056_lab02/`.
I copied a version into the `todo/` directory.

`archive_into_kernel.sh` is a script I wrote myself. After compiling, basically only the `.ko` file is needed to be packaged into the kernel along with `qemu.sh`.

`cryptomod.c`
You can refer to the comments. Besides the spec-required functions, the rest should be the same as the starter code.

One thing to pay attention to is the `DEC` + `ADV` scenario.
In this case, you must always keep one block in the buffer before receiving the final block; otherwise, it won’t be able to decrypt the padding properly.

||In theory, for side-channel issues with multi-threading, just locking everything with mutex should work. But in my case, if I don’t add `printk` at the beginning and end of a function, it causes multithreading issues—so there’s probably a bug||

||Also, ~~since this was a long time ago~~, I honestly don’t remember all the issues I encountered while writing it. If I study kernel modules more in the future, I’ll try to come back and add any useful notes||
